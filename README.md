# Space-Scene-PC
![Game preview](./Screenshots/Preview.png)
An illusious game in space made for my thesis project.
#
This game contains illusions and visual tricks.

The goal is to find the way to move forward on the level.

You know you beat the game when a counter appears. It means you finished the game in that amount of time.
 
## How to launch

The game is currently only available on a Windows 64-bit OS. However, most of the time 32-bit Windows is fine as well. To play the game, simply click on

`⬇ Code > Download ZIP`

After downloading, you should be able to unzip and launch the Space-Scene-PC-main/Illusion.exe file.
